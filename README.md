# clojure-workshop-day

I took part in the Clojure workshop run by the Melbourne FP user group run on Saturday 23rd March 2013

Two sets of exercises.
First were classic FP style probs (Multiples of 3 and 5, Even Fibonacci Numbers, Largest Palindrome Product and
Smallest Multiple)
Then there was Conways game of life.

## Usage
Install lein and catnip
Run 'lein edit' from the command line to kick it off.

# TODOs for the FP excercises
Finish Largest Palindrome and Smallest Multiple

# Future refactors for game of life
Make the less2 more3, etc functions actually become composed functions that take in the value and compose the condition
b/ween 2 and 3 from them.
Use protocols and other macros as a datastructure for the game

# TODO Tests
write some unit tests, esp those using the testing framework Logan demo'd (using fact and tables to validate lots of items)
